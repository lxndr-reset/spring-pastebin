Generation of sequences made alphabetical, i.e: abc -> abd -> abe -> ... -> abz -> aca -> ...
The 'last_sequence' value is needed as a start point for next generation. If your current last sequence is alphabetically
IS LESS THAN current value of a file, you can change it to become a start point.

BE SURE THAT URL SEQUENCE IS UNIQUE!!!

'last_generated_amount' is amount that automatically increases itself when links are generated. Not recommended for manual
edition.

Links are being generated every 12 hours if program decides that remained links are not enough for current messages amount.

Use schema.sql to create SQL tables that compatible with current app version.
